 Initialize On Object Creation
i. Create a class Car which contains wheels and model as Instance variables.
ii. Initialize the number of wheels of the car at the time of creating the Object of the 
car and assign the model of the car to the model variable and print the model after

  ANS:    class Caar1 
	{
	  int wheels;
	   String Model;
	   public static void main(String[]args)
	  {
		Caar1 s=new Caar1();
		Caar1 s1=new Caar1();
		s.wheels = 4;
		s.Model = "Honda";

		s1.wheels = 6;
		s1.Model = "suzuki";

		System.out.println("wheels is :"+s.wheels);
		System.out.println("Model is :"+s.Model);
		System.out.println("wheels is:"+s1.wheels);
		System.out.println("Model is:"+s1.Model);
	}
}
OUTPUT-:  
          wheels is :4
